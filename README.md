# Cloud-Press Pro Site Enabler #

### What is this for? ###

[Cloud-Press](http://cloud-press.net) offers a "pro" website feature that allows you to export your website to a remote server.
This plugin enables the pro features on an individual site instead of your overall account for absolutely no cost by exploiting a vulnerability in their system.


It has been a little less than a year since disclosing this vulnerability and it seems as if they have no interest in fixing it.  So now it is publicly avaliable to everyone!

A customer support staff member has replied to your support request, #560566 with the following response:
Hi {{REDACTED},
Thanks a lot for bringing this issue to our attention.
Sorry for not responding earlier - we've been in over our heads doing support and fixing bugs.
This one is also on our to do list but we had more important problems to fix that directly affected our clients. This is important, too, but our clients are not exactly the hacker kind :)
I'll check with the tech team to get a status on this and I'll let you know if we need any help with it.
Best regards,
Horea Radu
