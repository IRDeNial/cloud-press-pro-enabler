# Cloud-Press Pro Site Enabler #

### What is this for? ###

Cloud-Press offers a "pro" website feature that allows you to export your website to a remote server.
This plugin enables the pro features on an individual site instead of your overall account for absolutely no cost by exploiting a vulnerability in their system.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Create a Cloud-Press account
* Create a Cloud-Press website
* Install the plugin
* Enable the plugin

To revert back to your normal free website plan, just disable the plugin.

### CAUTION ###

This plugin is used for demonstration purposes of the vulnerability itself, not for general use.
